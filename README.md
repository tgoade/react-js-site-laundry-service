## About This Project

This is a personal project developed using React js.  The idea is to provide a service like Doordash or Grubhub, where those who don't want or have time to have their laundry done to have a service that would take care of it without them leaving their house.  The app allows the user to go through the authentication process and receives a text that a driver is coming to pick up their clothes.

Feel free to go through the authentication process, "schedule pickup now" and see what happens. Don't worry, I won't actually be picking up your laundry.
